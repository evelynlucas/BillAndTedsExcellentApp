# Bill And Ted's Excellent App

Welcome to San Dimas! This app contains three fragments:
1. A recyclerview that contains a list of some of the most significant characters that appear in the movies *Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure* and *Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey*. When a character's tile is clicked, you are taken to another page that has more information on that character.
2. A short questionnaire to determine which Bill & Ted character you are.
3. A webview showing the latest updates on the official Bill & Ted 3 twitter.
